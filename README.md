Python based pdf password remover with wordlist generator
to use this tool you've to install the python and pypdf2 tool.

after installing both open the "PDF_Password_Remover.exe" file and also place the password protected pdf file (file.pdf) in the same directory.

if you already have a wordlist file then just click on Run Script button.

if you don't have any wordlist file, click on the "Create Wordlist" file.
  1]  Enter the name of the wordlist file as .txt file.
  2] if you know the partial value of the password enter it (abc***** =8chars, **abcd** = 8 chars)
  3] change the target length as per the lenght of the password (minimum 1 to maximum 10)
  4] select the options such as numbers, upper cases, lower cased & symbols - atleast one charractor set must be selected to calculate the wordlist.
  5] click on generate.

after generating the wordlist file select and click the Run Script Button.

Thank you!!!...
